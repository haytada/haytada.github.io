## Earning Points
You can earn points in 3 ways... kind of. First of all, activity! You will receive anywhere from 0 to 3 points per message you send.

You can redeem channel points from my Twitch channel for points. The conversion ratio for this is approximately 1.5x. Type **!redeemcoins** in #bot-commands to notify staff you have redeemed coins. Once approved, a member of staff will transfer your funds. 100 points is 70 channel points.

You can gamble for more points, but beware, you could also lose points! (We'll get to how further down).  

## Checking Points
To see how many points you have got simply type **!points** in #bot-commands. You can also type **!leaderboard** in #bot-commands to see who has the most in the server!  

## Using Points
To check what is for sale simply type **!buy** in #bot-commands and you can scroll through the items, each item will tell you how to purchase it. Some items have restrictions but these will be made clear before buying anything.

## Self Promotion
This channel has undergone the biggest change. You can now buy the Advertise item which will be valid for one use only.

**Advertise** - This will allow you to post a link to your content but it will also be promoted in almost every channel in the server for the biggest reach of potential viewers. In order to make the most of this you need to use the command **!promote** before your message. We are not obligated to refund your points if you forget to use the command. Your content also must still include a link otherwise it will be automatically deleted.

## Gambling
You can always choose to gamble your points! These commands need to be used in the #bot-commands channel.

**!coinflip <heads/tails> (amount to bet)**
**!dice <1-6> (amount to bet)**
